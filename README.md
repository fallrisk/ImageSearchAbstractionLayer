I used the [Imgur API](http://api.imgur.com/).

## User Stories (Requirements)
* User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
* User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL
* User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

## Setup
This project was done in Webstorm 11.0.3 with babel-cli set as a file watcher.
